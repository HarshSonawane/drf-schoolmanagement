## Details - 
1. For Authentication purposes I have used Django-Allauth and Django-Rest-Auth libaries in my previous project and in this one I have done everything without using those libraries.

2. As login fields are common in both school and student I have tried make use of the user model which comes by default with django, with another approach we can have all the fields seprately and all the login and signup api's seprately. Here I have tried to use few things in common and few functionalities seprate.

3. We can also define and use the custom permissions in pace of the mannuald conditions.
4. Followed rest routing to have the school specific students and list.
